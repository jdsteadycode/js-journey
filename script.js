/*
  DAY 7: Truthy ‚úÖ & Falsy ‚ùé Values in JavaScript

// 7Ô∏è‚É£ Which of the following is falsy in JavaScript? 0, "hello", {}, undefined, [], false ?
// ANS: Falsy Values ‚ùé are 0, undefined, false.

// 8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the output of Boolean(" ") in JavaScript?
// ANS: true because " " or ' ' or ` ` contains a white-space.
// Thus, A whitespace is considered as an character in a string so it's a Truthy Value ‚úÖ

// 9Ô∏è‚É£ Will "0" (a string) be treated as truthy or falsy?
// "0" will be obviously treated as Truthy Value ‚úÖ.
// Just like in question 8Ô∏è‚É£, Any character placed inside string or string literal is considered as an valid character which are Truthy by-default!

// üîü What happens when you use !!value in JavaScript?
// It will give negate or reverse the Boolean Value  **twice** i.e., strict Boolean Value conversion.
// But let's assume it contains a value like '0' (Falsy Value ‚ùé)
// Here double-negation operator `!!` is used to check whether value is Falsy ‚ùé || Truthy ‚úÖ.
// It would return `false` as EX:!0 -> true then, !true is false.


// 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the output of Boolean([])?
// It returns `true` as empty [], {} i.e., objects and arrays are considered as Truthy Values ‚úÖ.


// 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ How does JavaScript evaluate the following: if (null) { console.log("Truthy"); } else { console.log("Falsy"); }?
// As if condition wouldn't satisy "null" as true this is because `null` is by-default Falsy Value ‚ùé.

/*
  DAY 8: Comparison Operators in JavaScript üöÄ

// 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?
/*
 ANS.
  `==` operator - simple equality check operator. It cross checks the value of the given expressions.
  It converts type implicitly to match the expressions, this is initiated behind-the-scenes by JS Engine
  Thus output can be in-appropriate.

  `===` operator - strict equality check operator. It cross checks the value as well as type of given expressions.
  It doesn't implicitly converts type of the expression. Thus, output seems reliable here.

  NOTE: `===` is recommended over `==` operator due to accurate and reliable output!
*/

// 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ What will 5 == "5" return and why?
// ANS: true.
/*
  Because of `==` operator (simple equality check).
  As `==` operator just checks the value of expressions given & An JS Engine coverts "5" -> 5 implicitly behind the scenes.
  Thus output is `true`, which is inappropriate logically.

  NOTE: To use `===` operator as mentioned above in question 13.
*/

// 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ What is the output of true == 1?
// ANS. true.
/*
  This because expressions where in first one `true` is a Truthy Value ‚úÖ And, `1` is also Truthy Value ‚úÖ.
  Thus `==` operator check if both values match or not! With an implicit type conversion intiated by JS Engine behind-the-scenes.
  Thus, as both are Truthy it returns Boolean `true`.
*/


// 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ What happens when you compare null >= 0 in JavaScript?
// ANS. true
/*
  `>=` greater than and equal to operator checks if given expression is larger than the other and also additionally checks if it's equal or not!
  And, JS Engine implicitly converts value of `null` to 0.
  Thus 0 >= 0 results to Boolean true.

  NOTE: comparison operators work slight differently than logical operators so here value gets converted to different one to be compared!
*/


// 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What will NaN === NaN return?
// ANS. false
/*
  Because, NaN is Falsy Value ‚ùé that isn't equal to itself.
  So it returns Boolean false.
*/

// 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the result of "5" > 3 in JavaScript, and why?
// ANS. true.
/*
  `>` - greater than operator. 
  It checks if given expression is larger than the other or not! 
  Also JS Engine does implicit type coversion for the expression if needed!
  As "5" -> 5 so, 5 > 3 which is true.
  Thus it returns Boolean true.

/*
 ANS && Justification.
  console.log(true && 0) -> 0 
  This happens as `&&` Operator assesses Truthy and Falsy Values.
  And, as here `&&` Operator returns Truthy Value only if both values or expressions are Truthy or true.
  As if here 0 is the Falsy Value it straightaway returns `Falsy Value`.

  //. 2
  console.log(false || "Hello") -> "Hello"
  Here Logical `||` Operator also assesses the Truthy and Falsy Value But, in a different way.
  As, here it would return Truthy Value even if there's only one Truthy Value or a Falsy Value.
  So it returns "Hello".

  //. 3
  console.log(!"") -> true.
  `!` is Logical Not or Negation Operator as, it reverses the Boolean Truthy || Falsy value and returns the reversed Boolean Value.
  So here As "" is a Falsy Value Thus, !"" returns it's opposite i.e., True or Truthy Value.

  NOTE: logical operators do work for Truthy & Falsy Values...

 ANS && Justification.
  console.log(null || undefined);   // undefined
  As '||' Operator checks for atleast one Truthy Value in whole input expression.

  Since As it finds both are Falsy Values [null & undefined] So, it prints second Falsy Value.

  //. 2
